# ShopX
Data Analysis for E-commerce sales

## Business Context
ShopX, a rapidly growing e-commerce marketplace in Southeast Asia similar to Shopee, operates a vast network of third-party sellers and an in-house delivery service, ShopX Express. As of early 2026, the company faces mounting pressure from rising operational costs and intense competition from rising social-commerce platforms. To maintain its market leadership, ShopX is shifting its focus from aggressive expansion to sustainable profitability by optimizing fulfillment efficiency and reducing order cancellations.

## Problem Background
Recent internal audits revealed a significant discrepancy between "Shipped" and "Delivered" statuses, with a high volume of orders being canceled post-payment, particularly in high-density urban areas like Mumbai and Bengaluru. Stakeholders have noted that while the platform achieves a 97% delivery success rate on average, certain categories like "kurta" and "western dress" suffer from higher return and cancellation rates, potentially due to sizing inconsistencies or late fulfillment. This volatility impacts seller confidence and increases reverse logistics costs.

## Stakeholder Request
"We are seeing a trend where nearly 15% of orders are marked as 'Cancelled' despite being processed by merchants. Can you analyze our sales and fulfillment data to identify the primary drivers of cancellations—be it courier performance, regional logistics delays, or specific product category issues—and recommend how we can improve our successful delivery rate?"

## Phase 1: Problem Definition
The ultimate goal for Shop X is:
- Optimizing fulfillment efficiency
- Reduce order cancellations

Some questions I will have in mind based on these goals are:
- Out of 10, how efficient is the fulfillment process? Why did you rate it as such?
- What is the current order cancellation rate? By how much are we aiming to reduce the order cancellation rate?

Current problems faced by the company are:
- Very high cancellation rate at post payment in areas like Mumbai/Bengaluru
- Certain categories like "kurta", "western" dress suffer higher return and cancellation rates

Consequences faced by ShopX from these problems are:
- Impacts seller confidence on marketing their products on the platform
- Increases reverse logistics cost for returns

In conclusion, what we need to find out:
- What is the root cause of the cancellation of orders?
- What are some recommendations to prevent this?

## Phase 2: Data preparation
