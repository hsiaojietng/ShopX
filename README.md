# ShopX
Data Analysis for E-commerce sales

## Business Context
ShopX, a rapidly growing e-commerce marketplace in Southeast Asia similar to Shopee, operates a vast network of third-party sellers and an in-house delivery service, ShopX Express. As of early 2026, the company faces mounting pressure from rising operational costs and intense competition from rising social-commerce platforms. To maintain its market leadership, ShopX is shifting its focus from aggressive expansion to sustainable profitability by optimizing fulfillment efficiency and reducing order cancellations.

## Problem Background
Recent internal audits revealed a significant discrepancy between "Shipped" and "Delivered" statuses, with a high volume of orders being canceled post-payment, particularly in high-density urban areas like Mumbai and Bengaluru. Stakeholders have noted that while the platform achieves a 97% delivery success rate on average, certain categories like "kurta" and "western dress" suffer from higher return and cancellation rates, potentially due to sizing inconsistencies or late fulfillment. This volatility impacts seller confidence and increases reverse logistics costs.

## Stakeholder Request
"We are seeing a trend where nearly 15% of orders are marked as 'Cancelled' despite being processed by merchants. Can you analyze our sales and fulfillment data to identify the primary drivers of cancellations—be it courier performance, regional logistics delays, or specific product category issues—and recommend how we can improve our successful delivery rate?"
